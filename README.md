# 🌐 **S-RAY**
## **Real-Time Crowd Awareness & Safety Guidance Platform**

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://sray.netlify.app

### **S-RAY** is a human-centered, privacy-first platform designed to **detect crowd congestion in real time and guide people toward safer movement decisions** in public spaces.

Rather than reacting to emergencies, S-RAY focuses on **early awareness, smart guidance, and prevention** — quietly working in the background to reduce risk before danger appears.

---

## 🚨 **The Problem**

Large public spaces such as **events, campuses, transport hubs, and gatherings** often suffer from:

- Sudden overcrowding  
- Lack of real-time crowd visibility  
- Delayed response to congestion  
- Increased risk of panic, accidents, and health emergencies  

Most existing systems are **reactive, manual, or surveillance-heavy**, responding only after situations escalate.

---

## 💡 **Our Solution**

**S-RAY provides real-time crowd intelligence that helps people decide:**

> **Where to go · When to move · When to avoid an area**

The platform:
- Continuously monitors crowd density and flow  
- Detects high-risk congestion zones early  
- Suggests **safer, less crowded exit paths**  
- Supports authorities and organizers with **clear, visual insights**

S-RAY transforms complex live data into **simple, actionable safety guidance**.

---

## 🌍 **Vision**

To redefine public safety by creating **intelligent spaces** where real-time crowd awareness prevents risk **before it arises**, allowing people to move freely, confidently, and safely.

---

## 🎯 **Mission**

- Reduce crowd-related accidents through real-time monitoring and smart exit guidance  
- Enable **drone-based observation** for wide-area awareness  
- Integrate **pressure-based systems** that enhance accuracy and support **renewable energy generation**  
- Deliver **scalable, ethical, and privacy-first** safety solutions for public spaces of all sizes

## 🧠 **Core Innovation**

### **Multi-Modal Crowd Accuracy Model**

S-RAY improves reliability by combining:
- Vision-based crowd estimation  
- Mobile device density signals  
- Pressure-based physical validation  

This **data-fusion approach** minimizes sensor bias and increases trust in real-time insights.

---

## 🚦 **Smart Exit Safety Concept**

S-RAY helps users answer one critical question:

> **“Is it safe to go — or should I take another path?”**

The system:
- Detects congestion in real time  
- Highlights smoother, safer exit routes  
- Updates guidance dynamically as conditions change  

Safety becomes **preventive**, not reactive.

---

## 🔭 **Future Enhancements**

- Pressure-based flooring that also generates **renewable energy**  
- Expanded **drone coverage** across monitored zones  
- Emergency evacuation guidance  
- City-scale public safety integration  

---

## 🧰 **Technology Stack (Prototype)**

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **UI/UX:** Animated interactions & dynamic visual indicators  
- **Core Concepts:** Computer Vision, Geo-Fencing, Data Fusion  
- **Deployment:** Netlify  

---

## 🔐 **Privacy & Ethics**

S-RAY is built with public trust at its core:

- No facial recognition  
- No personal identity tracking  
- No invasive surveillance  

> **S-RAY understands movement — not people.**
